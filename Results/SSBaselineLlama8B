----------------------------FULL PROGRAM (baseline, llama 8B)----------------------------
Here is the ASP program:

% Hard constraints
1. #show no_same_game_day(team1, team2, venue, gameday) :- team1 \= team2, team1 @ team2, gameday1 @ gameday2.
2. #show play_all(team) :- team @ team1, team @ team2, team1 \= team2.
3. #show no_self_game(team) :- team @ team1, team1 = team.

% Soft constraints
4. #minimize(venue_distance(team1, team2, gameday)) :- team1 @ team2, gameday @ gameday1.

% Generator
5. game(team1, team2, venue, gameday) :- team1 @ team2, team1 \= team2, gameday @ gameday1.
6. venue_distance(team1, team2, gameday) :- game(team1, team2, _, gameday).

%Syntax is already terrible.
