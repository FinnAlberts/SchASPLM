% Wrong: generates a game for every combination of teams *and* gameday.

% Hard constraint: No team plays each other more than once at different gamedays
:- game(team1, team2, _, gameday1), game(team1, team2, _, gameday2), gameday1!= gameday2.
% Correct


% Hard constraint: Every team plays every other team at least once
:- team(team1), team(team2), team1!= team2, not game(team1, team2, _, _).
%Correct

% Hard constraint: No team plays itself
:- game(team, team, _, _).
% Correct

% Soft constraint: Teams should play at the same venue as little as possible
penalty(1) :- game(team1, team2, venue, _), game(team1, team3, venue, _), team2!= team3.
