% Hard Constraints

% Students must not have overlapping events.

%Correct

% The amount of students in a room at the same time should not exceed the capacity of the room
:- assigned(Event, Timeslot, Room), #count{Student : student(Student, Event)} > Capacity, room(Room, Capacity).
%:- room(Room, Capacity), timeslot(Timeslot, _, _),    #count{Student : student(Student, Event), assigned(Event, Timeslot, Room)} > Capacity.
%Check in paper: deepseeks sems to have it right.

% Rooms must have the required features for the event.
:- assigned(Event, _, Room), feature_requirement(Feature, Event), not room_feature(Feature, Room).
%Correct

% There must be no more than one event in a room at a time.

% Events may only be scheduled in designated timeslots.
